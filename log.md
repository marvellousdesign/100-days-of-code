# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've trail through the html, css and bootstrap parts on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've started coding for a year or so, so I have a good foundation in html & css, and need to move forward.

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finish bootstrap & jQuery lessons from FreeCodeCamp, and started working on a one page portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I'm currently not fond of the current iteration of bootstrap 4 beta 5 support for flexbox, there was many frustration points today.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Making progress on my portfolio, and figure out the padding issue in my nav (because of the ul element).

**Thoughts**: It's still taking too long to finish a one pager and figure out the nooks and cranny about bootstrap 4 beta 5. I hope beta 6 comes out as they removed all the floats, and used flexbox.

### Day 4: Jan 6, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I finished my portfolio for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I lost my small 3 day streak at FreeCodeCamp, while finishing up my Portfolio, and now I'm moving on to javascript. Although while doing this project, I feel like learning SASS/SCSS would of been helpful.

### Day 5: Jan 7, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Diving into FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Curriculum.

**Thoughts**: Most like need to supplement with other JavaScript courses to get a better understanding of it, other than from FCC.

### Day 6: Jan 8, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Updating my portfolio from Bootstrap 4 beta 5 to beta 6.

**Thoughts**: I tried to be as productive after some lost time with a banquet meeting.. I giving myself a task to update my site to bootstrap 4 beta 6.

### Day 7: Jan 9, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finish Portfolio, and continuing learning JavaScript via FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I spent the wee mornings reading the documentation for bootstrap 4 beta 6, and I can say it's much cleaner. I have less css overiding bootstrap's and less of a hacky nav.

### Day 8: Jan 10, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finish more JavaScript challanges at FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I feel like I learn better if it's more interactive like CodeCombat, there are a few concepts I already know such as if else statements, switchs was new, and the Counting Cards challange was hard.

### Day 9: Jan 11, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished JavaScript challanges at FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: It seems I spent 4 days finishing this section, and probably not the most effective use my time since I get distracted easily. I still need a better understand of JavaScript by reading other resouces.

### Day 10: Jan 13, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Joining #301DaysOfCode and progressing onto FCC's Object Oriented and Functional Programming

**Thoughts**: My thoughts are the same as I updated the readme. I'm taking up the challange to go from 100 to 301 Days Of Code, because ultimately I want to go beyond a Designer to Developer(well in anycase, a more well rounded Developer with a sense for Design, and UX/UI).

### Day 11: Jan 14, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Getting started with Algorithm

**Thoughts**: I'm using other resources to learn about Algorithm such as [Khanacademy's Algorithms course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/) by two Dartmouth college professors Tom Cormen and Devin Balkcom, to go along with FreeCodeCamp's basic algorithmic challages for a better understanding.
