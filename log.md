# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1-2: Aug 21 & 23 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting back to Coding, Starting with C#

**Thoughts**: Classes started up again and I'm taking CIS 23 C#, which maybe the hardest class I have. This week was more of a review what was covered in CIS 6 C++, we talked about differences and what changed in C#, and similarities to Java.

I'm aiming to use C# in Unity for game design and I've also backed [Zenva: Game Development Mini-Degree](https://kickstarter.com/projects/pablofarias/game-development-mini-degree-learn-to-code-and-mak/) up on kickstarter. I almost never by a course, if there are free resources available (SF Library with Lynda & teamtreehouse, Udemy with 100% off).


### Day 3: Aug 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting back into JavaScript

**Thoughts**: MMART 168... We talked about JavaScript data primatives and objects, which is not new to me.

### Day 4-5: Aug 28 & 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Intro to C#

**Thoughts**: Read chapter 3 Intro to C# App Programming & chapter 4 of the book on Intro to Classes, Objects, Methods and strings.


### Day 6: Aug 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Understanding the DOM

**Thoughts**: We learn how to use the command line, the DOM(Document Object Model), review on html selectors and tags, css rulesets, and setting up Atom.


### Day 7-9: Sep 1-3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning Git/Github basics & JavaScript DOM Manipulation on Lynda

**Thoughts**: Watched part 1 & 2 of the assigned Git Lynda courses, but it's a little dated so I looked at another course, and updated my Git install. It will take some time and practice to remember how to use git in terminal.

**Lynda**: [GitHub for Web Designers](https://www.lynda.com/GitHub-tutorials/GitHub-Web-Designers/162276-2.html), [Learning Git and GitHub](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Up-Running-Git-GitHub/409275-2.html), [JavaScript Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Essential-Training/574716-2.html)


### Day 10: Sep 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rewatch 1/2 of [Foundations Programming: Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Foundations-Programming-Fundamentals/83603-2.html) @ Lynda

**Thoughts**: Getting back to the basics, and it's a good thing that JavaScript is a C-based programming language. It will definitely help with solidify knowledge with what I already know from C++ and reviewing more JavaScript courses/youtube vids.


### Day 11: Sep 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting Lost in C#

**Thoughts**: More on Classes, Constructors, Methods, Private & Public..


### Day 12: Sep 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: DOM Interactions & Traversing Objects & Arrays

**Thoughts**: Exploring JavaScript Objects & Arrays in the browser.


### Day 13-15: Sep 8-9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Taking Flatiron Schoolâ€™s #BacktoCode Challenge @ [Learn.co](https://learn.co)

**Thoughts**: It's 21-day challenge, and it'll help with learning JavaScript fundamentals.


### Day 16-19: Sep 11-14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting Lost in C#, HW03 for JavaScript, & Zipping through [Learn.co](https://learn.co/marvellousdesign)

**Thoughts on C#**: More on Classes, Constructors, Methods, Private & Public..

**Thoughts on JavaScript#**: JavaScript DOM Manipulations of a sample Twitter page. It's required to write an anaysis for class, and since I'm already reading web dev articles I guess can try to improve my writing.

**Thoughts on Learn.co**: I'm 48% (23 / 47 completed) of the JavaScript fundamentals lessons. I like their structure in their lessons and labs, although some of their lab instructions isn't that clear, but they have good support. Although sometimes I figure it out myself after asking the questions. Finish the short course on [Learning Git and GitHub](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Up-Running-Git-GitHub/409275-2.html) @ Lynda.
