# #301DaysOfCode

*Post from* [Benjamin Spak][1]

Want to go from code noob to employed front-end developer in less than a year?

Inspired by the [#100DaysOfCode challenge FreeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) (ðŸ”¥) put out, Iâ€™m taking it a step further and going from code noob to junior front-end developer over the course of 301 days. The remaining 64 of the year will be focused on landing a front-end developer job.

It has been my dream to be a programmer, but I have not accomplished it. Join me. [2017 is the year](http://benjaminspak.com/2017-year-plan/) to become a programmer!

Start programming using any tool, book, or course you come across. I like Code Academy, FreeCodeCamp, and the Head First book series.

It does not matter when in the year you start, but within the next 365 dedicate 301 of them to coding.

The only stipulation; code one hour per day for 301 days.

To join in, use the [#301DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/301DaysofCode) hashtag on any social network to tell people how much ass you are kicking this year!

Feeling a little crazy? Good! Join me on my other [challenges for the year](http://benjaminspak.com/challenges/).

## FAQ

### Why 301 days? Why not 365?

We spend 301 days learning to code. The remaining 64 days of the year are focused on landing a front-end developer job.

Cheers is you got the 301 redirect reference ðŸ˜‰

### I'm doing #100DaysOfCode can I do #301DaysOfCode too?

Of course my friend! Most people doing #100DaysOfCode are also doing #301DaysOfCode.

100 days is focused on getting you to form a coding habit. Which is awesome, but requires you to know Git right from the start.

301 days is focused on taking you from knowing nothing to landing a front-end developer job within a year. We [cover HTML 5, CSS3, JQuery, Command Line, Git and JavaScript](http://benjaminspak.com/challenges/301-days-code/updates/).

### Can I market or mention #301DaysOfCode?

Absolutely! Weâ€™re all about getting new coders on board. When you create something please use our hash, or link to this page so more people can join us ^_^
